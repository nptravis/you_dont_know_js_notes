	// Chapter 3: Into YDKJS ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	
	// Scope and Closures
	// on of the most important concepts early on is to really learn how scope and closures really work.
	// JS is not an interpreted language, it is a compiled language
	  // the JS engine compiles your code right before (and sometimes during!) execution.
	// deep undertanding of the module pattern should be one of your highest priorities.

	// this and Object Prototypes
	// this keyword doesn't refer to the function it is called in, it is dynamically bound based on how the function   // is executed. There are four simple rules to understand.
	// Object prototype mechanism, closely related to the this keyword, is a look-up chain for properties, not the idea of emulating (fake) classes and (so called "prototypal") inheritance.
	// proper use of Object prototypes is named "behavior delegation", a more powerful way to design than class and inheritance.

	// Types and Grammar
	// implicit coersion is very powerful, and shouldn't be thought of as "evil" or a "flaw". It must be learned deeply, and will up your JS game, making your code better.

	// Async and Performance
		// to be serious about programng effectivly in an asyn world, you need to get comfortable with combining promises ad generators.
		// promises are a time-independant wrapper around a "future" value which lets you reason about and compose them regardless of if the value is ready or not
		// generators offer a new mode to execute JS functions, can be paused at 'yield' points and resumed asychronously later

		// Program parallelism with Web Workers and data parellelism with SIMD, and ASM.js

		// Performance optimization
		// what kinds of performance to worry about and what to ignore

  // ES6 and Beyond
  // some things to look forward to reading about in ES6 include: destructuring, default parameter values, symbols, concise methods, computed properties, arrow functions, block scoping, promises, generators, iterators, modules, proxies, weakmaps, and more.

  // It is an indepth look at JS, it gets heavy, don't be a bitch...
