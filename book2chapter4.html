	// Chapter 4: Hoisting ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// Scope is the idea of variables attaching to the scope of the function or block they are called in.
	// Hoisting is how these attachments work depending on where they are called in the function or block.

	// Chicken or the Egg?
	a = 2;
	var a;
	console.log(a); // 2

	// or:
	console.log(a); // undefined, not ReferenceError because compiler sets var a before execution, but doesn't assign it
	var a = 2;

	// The Compiler Strikes Again
	// All declerations, variables and functions, are processed first before any part of your code is executed
	var a = 2;
	var a; // Compiler sets var a
	a = 2; // assignment happens during execution.

	// Metaphorically the variable and function declarations are moved to the top of the code before execution, hence the term "Hoisting". The egg (declaration), comes before the chicken (assignment).
	//Note, only declarations are hoisted!!

	foo();

	function foo() {
		console.log(a); // undefined
		var a = 2;
	}

	// Hoisting works within the scope of the function, so var a is hoisted to the tope of foo(), not the top of the global scope
	// So this code can be more accurately interpreted like:
	function foo() {
		var a;
		console.log(a); // undefined
		a = 2;
	}
  foo(); 
  
  // function declerations are hoisted, but function expressions are not
  
  foo(); // not ReferenceError, TypeError!
  var foo = function bar() {
  	//....
  };

  // TypeError because variable declaration of foo() is hoisted, but it's assignment is not, so foo() looks like a function without a value. So, foo() is trying to invoke the undefined value, which is a TypeError
  foo(); // TypeError
  bar(); // ReferenceError, compiler thinks bar() doesn't exist

  var foo = function bar() {
  	// ...
  };
  
  // this snippet is hoisted as:
   var foo;
   foo(); // TypeError
   bar(); // ReferenceError

   foo = function(){
   	var bar = ...self...
   	// ...
   }

  // Functions First
  // functions declarations are hoisted before variable declarations
  foo(); // 1

  var foo();

  function foo() {
  	console.log(1);
  }

  foo = function() {
  	console.log(2)
  }

  // This snippet is interpreted by the engine as:
  function foo() {
  	console.log(1);
  }

  foo(); // 1

  foo = function() {
  	console.log(2);
  }
  // the var foo was ignored, becuase it was a duplicate that was hoisted after the function foo. Now, multiple function declarations with the same name, the last declared one will override previous ones
  
  foo(); // 3
   
   function foo() {
   	console.log(1);
   }

   var foo = function() {
   	console.log(2);
   };

   function foo() {
   	console.log(3);
   }
  
  // Function declarations that appear inside of normal blocks typically hoist to the enclosing scope, rather than being conditional as this code implies:
  
  foo(); // "b"

  var a = true;

  if (a) {
  	function foo() {console.log("a");}
  }
  else {
  	function foo() {console.log("b");}
  }

  // Review /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // As code is compiled, function and variable delarations are hoisted to the top of their respective scope.
  // Only declerations are hoisted, not assignments, not even assingments of function expressions
  // best to just avoid using mutliple declerations with the same name.
